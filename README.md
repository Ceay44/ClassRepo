## Repository Overview

We have organized the repository into several subfolders:

1. **[HTML/Resources and Lecture Slides](./HTML/Resources%20and%20Lecture%20Slides)**  
   Find PDF or PowerPoint slides from class lectures, as well as additional resources (articles, links, or examples) to help you learn.

2. **[HTML/Class Note](./HTML/Class%20Note)**  
   This folder contains any class notes, study guides, or summaries of topics discussed in class.

3. **[HTML/Assignment](./HTML/Assignment)**  
   Here, you’ll find instructions, starter code (if any), and requirements for each assignment. Check back regularly for new or updated assignments.

## How to Use this Repository

1. **Clone This Repo**  
   - If this is your first time, clone the repo to your local machine:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ceay44/ClassRepo.git
     ```
   - This creates a local folder named `ClassRepo/`.

2. **Pull Updates Daily**  
   - We will add new notes, slides, and assignments here throughout the course.
   - Each day (or whenever you start working), **pull the latest changes**:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - This ensures your local copy is up to date with the instructor’s version.

3. **Copy Materials to Your Personal Repo**  
   - You should **not** push changes to this repository. Instead, maintain your own repository for your solutions or personal notes.
   - After pulling the latest updates in `ClassRepo/`, copy the relevant files (assignments, notes, etc.) into your personal repo. Example:
     ```bash
     cp -r ClassRepo/HTML/Assignment/Assignment1 ~/MyWorkRepo/Assignment1
     ```
   - Then, commit and push in your own repository.

4. **Submit Your Work**  
   - If you have an assignment due, push your solution code to your personal GitHub repo and share it as instructed (e.g., a link to your fork, pull request, or personal repository).
